CMake Deprecation Warning at cmake/Custom.cmake:6 (cmake_policy):
  The OLD behavior for policy CMP0037 will be removed from a future version
  of CMake.

  The cmake-policies(7) manual explains that the OLD behaviors of all
  policies are deprecated and that a policy should be set to OLD only under
  specific short-term circumstances.  Projects should be ported to the NEW
  behavior and not rely on setting a policy to OLD.

CMake Error at source/tests/fiblib-test/CMakeLists.txt:32 (add_executable):
  Target "fiblib-test" links to target "template::fiblib" but the target was
  not found.  Perhaps a find_package() call is missing for an IMPORTED
  target, or an ALIAS target is missing?
